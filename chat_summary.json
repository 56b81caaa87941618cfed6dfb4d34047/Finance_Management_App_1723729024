Specifically, the AI asked if the form should allow direct integration with Uniswap for live swaps or collect user requests for analysis. The user also had to specify the type of information the form should gather, whether basic swap information or more detailed data that includes wallet address and slippage percentage. The AI then provided a checklist of additional features for implementation, where the user confirmed certain features like a swap form with asset selection, transaction history, and a gas fee calculator, while opting out of real-time crypto price charts and swap status notifications.\n\nMoreover, the AI presented another set of features related to a customizable background image for the interface, asking whether the pink planet background should be static or dynamically generated and if it should be responsive to different screen sizes. The user indicated a preference for the background to be dynamically generated. Throughout the interaction, the AI affirmed its understanding of the user's requirements, confirming that it would work on implementing the respective features, including the pink planet scene as a background image. The conversation showcases the process of refining user preferences in creating an interactive, user-friendly interface for crypto swaps.",
